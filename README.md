## Script Marks

### Derived Sheet Mark
This mark was created to easily identify the parent sheet size from which a derived stock was created. Imposition AI has an option "Use derived sheets" which allows Phoenix to consider half and quarter sheet sizes. This mark simply adds some text to the layout to indicate the original sheet size.

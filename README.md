## Script Marks

### Derived Sheet Mark
This mark was created to easily identify the parent sheet size from which a derived stock was created. Imposition AI has an option "Use derived sheets" which allows Phoenix to consider half and quarter sheet sizes. This mark simply adds some text to the layout to indicate the original sheet size.

## Imposition AI

### Derived Sheet Layout Property
This script was created to easily identify the parent sheet size from which a derived stock was created. Imposition AI has an option "Use derived sheets" which allows Phoenix to consider half and quarter sheet sizes. This script simply adds a custom layout property to call out the original sheet size.
